<h3>Raytraced Video</h3>
<h4>Computer Graphics Final Project</h4>
<a href="/images/472Video1.png"><img src="/images/472Video1.png" alt="Raytraced video screenshot"  width="325px" /></a>
<p>Our final project for my computer graphics class was to create a raytraced video at least one
minute in length. Working with three other studends and greatly expanding upon raytracing code we
had been developing throuought the entire semester, we created a fun, colorful video of a surfer at
a beach complet with sand, waves, trees, a beach umbrella, and a beach ball being tossed between two
people. Of course it's not just any ordinary surfer: our professor required that our project include
reflections, so our video is none other than THE Silver Surfer showing off his skills.</p>

<p>The project was written in C++ and gave us the opportunity to learn all about the intricacies of
ray tracing and computer graphics. Despite being a simple raytracer by almost any standards, our 60
second video rendered at a resolution of only 640x480 took 27 computers 9 hours to render. This
project definitely made us appreciate all the work that goes into big-budget computer generated
films.</p>

<p>We still have our final <a href="/images/472video.avi">video</a>, a 7.5MB .avi file encoded using
H.264 (use <a href="http://videolan.org">VLC!</a>). Additionally, I've taken some concepts from the
source code and put them in <a href="https://github.com/orangejulius/jaytrace">my own raytracer</a>.
It's not as powerful, but it's one of those projects I always want to go back and work on more
someday.</p>

<h3>Rubik's Cube Solver</h3>
<h4>Artificial Intelligence Coding Assignment</h4>
<a href="/images/rubikscube.png"><img src="/images/rubikscube-small.png" alt="Rubik's Cube Solver" width="250px" /></a>
<p>One of the projects for my class on artificial intelligence required us to build a Rubik's Cube
solver.  This was a very fun project since the problem space for the Rubik's Cube is enormous. Of
course, solvers already exist that will quickly give you a set of moves to solve any state of the
cube. This is not one of those solvers. The project was designed to be an exercise in searching, and
therefore instead uses the A* best-first search algorithm to produce an optimal result.</p> <p>My
solver is a command line application written in Python. It has a simple interface that displays a
color representation of the cube. There are commands to manipulate the cube just like in real life,
as well as other commands to randomly scramble the cube as well as try to solve the cube in its
current state.</p>

<p>This is one of those projects I could have just kept working on forever. There would always be
more things to tweak. The search algorithm is pretty simple, but it works. Currently there is some
code in place to try and reduce the number of duplicate states checked (for example if in the last
step a certain move was made, making the opposite move for the next step does not make sense).
Everything, helps because the number of states that have to be checked is huge. Just applying 5
random moves to a cube can put it in one of 1889568 states, although my solver will generally only
check a fraction of them, and finish in a few seconds. Applying 6 random moves has taken up to 20
minutes for a relatively fast computer to solve. Go beyond that, and you may be waiting for a while:
it's not hard to use up several gigabytes of memory.  </p>
<p>You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/orangejulius/jcube">Github</a>. I haven't
touched the code in some time, but it could be fun to improve this a little bit more in the
future.</p>

<h3>MyPFS</h3>
<h4>A web monitoring application for the Chrysler Corporation</h4>
<a href="/images/mypfs.jpg"><img src="/images/mypfs-small.png" alt="MyPFS screenshot" width="400px" /></a>
<p>MyPFS was a project that I worked on with three other students as part of my MSU Computer Science
capstone class. We created a JavaScript based web application for viewing reports from Chrysler's
Performance Feedback System, which is used to monitor assembly plant status. We used a Java backend
running on Apache Tomcat.</p>

<p>Compared to the old system, MyPFS is much more powerful and includes
features such as asynchronous background updates so users never need to refresh the page, custom
user profiles with support for user selected visual themes. Each of the modules on the page can be
dragged to whatever location the user prefers and can have settings customized depending on the
user's location.</p>
