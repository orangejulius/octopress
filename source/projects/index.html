<h3 class="project">Donation Party</h3>
<a href="/images/donationparty-screenshot.png"><img src="/images/donationparty-screenshot.png" alt="Donation Party screenshot" /></a>
<p>Donation Party was born at the Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/hack-to-the-future">Hack to the Future</a>
hackathon in December, 2012. Its goal is to allow groups of friends to "compete"
while donating to charity. To keep things light-hearted, the donation amounts are randomly chosen
and cannot exceed $20. The person who donates the highest amount is given a small reward using some
of the money with the vast majority going directly to the chosen charity.</p>

<p>During the hackathon itself, we built Donation Party using Python and Django. Saumel Clay hosts
the original <a href="https://github.com/samuelclay/donationparty">source</a> on Github.</p>

<p>Later, I rewrote the project myself using Ruby on Rails as a learning exercise. The project
also uses Pusher.js, the FirstGiving API, and, of course, Stripe. There is a live demo (with
payments currently in testing mode) at <a href="https://www.donationparty.com">https://www.donationparty.com</a>, and the full source
is on <a href="https://github.com/orangejulius/donationparty">Github</a>.</p>

<h3 class="project">Jaytrace</h3>

<a href="/images/jaytrace-screenshot.png"><img src="/images/jaytrace-screenshot.png" alt="Jaytrace bunnyscreenshot" /></a>
<p>Jaytrace is the project I work on when I want to scratch my computer graphics programming itch.
I've built three raytracers: one in college, one shortly after college (this one was hastily
assembled and eventually scrapped), and Jaytrace. Jaytrace has been built more slowly, and with a
little more care. Written in C++ with a CMake build system, Jaytrace uses Qt, Eigen, and
tinyobjloader so I can focus on the core raytracer algorithms. It actually has quite a few unit
tests (unusual for graphics programming). The full source with additional information about the
project is on <a href="https://github.com/orangejulius/jaytrace">Github</a>.

<h3 class="project">WebpassMap</h3>
<a href="/images/webpassmap-screenshot.png"><img src="/images/webpassmap-screenshot.png" alt="WebpassMap screenshot" /></a>

<p><a href="http://webpassmap.juliansimioni.com">WebpassMap</a> helps you easily find buildings in
San Francisco with the excellent Webpass internet service. It came to be from my frustration with
the complete, but user unfriendly list of addresses with Webpass service on Webpass's own website.
Though it was my first Ruby on Rails project, with a little work I was able to build a scraper that
periodically checks for new deployments of Webpass service, and displays them using the Google Maps
API.</p>

<h3 class="project">Bubblevine</h3>

<a href="/images/bubblevine-screenshot.png"><img src="/images/bubblevine-screenshot.png" alt="Bubblevine screenshot" /></a>

<p><a href="http://bubblevine.io">Bubblevine</a> allows you to quickly and easily display your Instagram pictures on your own website.
Using Pusher for websockets support, Bubblevine images will update as soon as you upload a new
picture to Instagram, without even a page refresh. It was built in just a night or two of coding
with <a href="https://twitter.com/huckpilot">Christopher Black</a>, who came up with the idea.
Bubblevine uses Sinatra, so it's dead simple, and the
<a href="https://github.com/orangejulius/bubblevine">source</a> is hosted on Github.</p>

<h3 class="project">NodeRide</h3>

<a href="/images/noderide-screenshot.png"><img src="/images/noderide-screenshot.png" alt="NodeRide screenshot" /></a>

<p><a href="http://noderide.juliansimioni.com/">NodeRide</a> was built in early 2012 as a quick
experiment with NodeJS. As a cyclist, I have a large collection of files with GPS and heart rate
data from my bike rides, and I wanted to do something with them. NodeRide won't replace Strava, but
I did learn a bit. Source: <a href="https://github.com/orangejulius/noderide">https://github.com/orangejulius/noderide</a></p>
