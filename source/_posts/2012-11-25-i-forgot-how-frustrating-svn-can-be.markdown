Yesterday, I was installing the latest KDE 4.10 beta, which is built from source.
The Gentoo KDE overlay already has ebuilds, which use KDE's SVN as the source, rather than a tarball.
While installing all the packages, there was a failure to install ```kdeartwork-wallpapers```:

This is a simple package, and since it is a live ebuild, I assumed a directory had been moved and set about debugging the problem.
I spent a good amount of time looking into the KDE eclasses, trying to figure out how to figure out what was being built.
Only after a while of this, during another attempt at compiling the package, did I realize that SVN could be the culprit.

A little digging revealed that indeed SVN, for reasons unknown, had done only a partial checkout of the repository.
Indeed trying manually to checkout the entire part of the repository required was never successful in one go: it took multiple manual resumes to checkout the complete repository.
Somehow, this error was never detected by Portage.

Having not even touched SVN for 8 months, after several years of begrudingly using it, I had totally forgotten the sort of pains it allowed.
