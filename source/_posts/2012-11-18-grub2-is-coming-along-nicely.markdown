Today I decided to resurrect an old piece of hardware I've had sitting useless for a while: an Asus Eee PC [1005PE]( http://ca.asus.com/en/Eee/Eee_PC/Eee_PC_1005PE_Seashell/#specifications).

As an experiment, and to pave the way for future experimentation I decided to use GRUB2.
I'm also trying out the no-multilib profile, so grub 0.xx is not supported.

I'm pleased to report that using GRUB2 on a normal, BIOS booting system was extremely easy.
Here's some information about how I did it.

## Partition Table

I'm using a single EXT4 partition, the simplest possible setup.

```
pebble ~ # cat /etc/fstab
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# noatime turns off atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't
# needed); notail increases performance of ReiserFS (at the expense of storage
# efficiency).  It's safe to drop the noatime options if you want and to
# switch between notail / tail freely.
#
# The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
# All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.
#
# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.
#

# <fs>                  <mountpoint>    <type>          <opts>          <dump/pass>

# NOTE: If your BOOT partition is ReiserFS, add the notail option to opts.
/dev/sda1               /               ext4            noatime         0 1
```

## Installation

I installed Gentoo's GRUB 2.00-rc1 package.

``` bash
echo "~sys-boot/grub-2.00" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/grub
```

## Setup

Since I'm using the standard ```make install``` to install kernel images to /boot, simply running ```grub2-mkconfig``` sets everything up:

``` console
pebble ~ # grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Generating grub.cfg ...
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.7-gentoo
Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.7-gentoo.old
done
```

That's it!
While there's more going on behind the scenes than GRUB1's simple grub.cfg file, in the case of a BIOS driven setup, everything Just Works.
