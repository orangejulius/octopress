I'm finally back home and settled in from a crazy and amazing week in Chicago. I just wanted to say
thanks to everyone for an amazing time. Speakers, attendees, staff, everyone.

To everyone I met or talked to during the week, it was great to see you.

Speakers! You guys gave some amazing talks and it was awesome to watch you give them and get to chat
with you about them later.

And last but not least, to everyone who attended my talk: thanks so much! I hope you had as much fun
listening as I did giving it. The slides are

and you can see the video of my talk from MWRC on

See you all at the next conference!
