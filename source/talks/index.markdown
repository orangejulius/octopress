## Software Development Lessons from the Apollo Program
### RailsConf 2014 - The Sheraton Hotel - Chicago, IL - April 24th, 2014

A second iteration of my talk from MWRC, this time with an additional story regarding women in
computing in the early 20th century. I actually think I gave an overall better talk at MWRC, but it
was fun to be able to give the same talk a second time, and RailsConf was long and overwhelming, but
incredibly fun.

## Software Development Lessons from the Apollo Program
### Mountain West Ruby Conference 2014 - The City Library - Salt Lake City, UT - March 21, 2014

A full-length talk describing the challenges faced by software developers writing code for the
Apollo Guidance Computer in the 1960's, how they overcame them with great success, and what we can
learn from their experiences even as developers probably not writing code going to the moon.

The MWRC crowd was a great, small group and giving this talk was a blast.

## You Too Can be a Web Server
### RailsBridge Lighting Talks - Github - San Francisco, CA - December 4th, 2013

A 5 minute live-coding lightning talk exposing the inner workings of web browsers and web servers by
hand writing HTTP requests and responses with netcat. As far as I know there's no video from this
event, and as a live-coding presentation there were no slides, but the Rails
[project](https://github.com/orangejulius/you-too-can-be-a-webserver) is fun to look at.
